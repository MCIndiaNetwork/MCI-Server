* OneBlock is a gamemode in which players have to spawn on an 1x1 platform. To obtain more blocks players have to break the platform. On breaking the platform, another block will spawn and this continues until you reach end of a phase. There are 10 phases in total and at the end of the last phase, it reverts to the first phase.

* OneBlock has its own dedicated XPfarm and PVP arena. Instead of having the 1.9+ update pvp system it has the 1.8 pvp system.

## How to get started in OneBlock?
* After you connect to the OneBlock server, do /ob to get to your own OneBlock island , once you are there you will find yourself standing on a block and nothing else around, now just mine the OneBlock, dont worry you wont fall off the oneblock while mining it, now expand the island by playing blocks you get from OneBlock around the OneBlock, Remember there is a scarcity of items here, so use knowingly.

There is just one Helpful command in OneBlock that gives list of all other commands
**/ob help**.
To know the commands for adding anyother player to your oneblock team, just type 
**/ob team help**

## Ranks
*  Just like survival, OneBlock too has some ranks with their own benefits-
1. **Ranger**: This rank gives you a [R] tag in the chat.
2. **Marshal**: This rank gives you a [M] tag in the chat.
3. **Templar**: This rank gives you a [T] tag in the chat .
4. **Paladin**: This rank gives you a [P] as well as it gives you access to open the potion shop in /shop.
5. **Sentinel**

## mcMMO 
* This is a plugin that adds some special abilities for player when grinded for it. It adds a RPG experience in OneBlock.

* More information about mcMMO is in their [Website](https://mcmmo.org/wiki/Main_Page)
but still for the information: 
**Skills**
mcMMO currently has 15 skills. Salvage and Smelting are child skills. Unlike normal skills, these skills aren't leveled up directly. Instead they are leveled up automatically as you level up their parent skills.
For example:   

                                  Smelting is the child of Mining and Repair

                                  Salvage is the child of Fishing and Repair




### Primary skills   

### Combat skills

**Acrobatics:** 120XP per half heart of damage is gained when taking fall damage. Any reduction of damage by use of hay bales, potions, enchantments etc. will reduce the amount of experience gained. If a roll or graceful roll has been executed, you will gain 80XP per half heart of damage instead of 120XP. This calculation uses the damage that would have been taken if you had not rolled.  

_Feather falling will double the amount of XP you earn from falling, regardless of its enchantment level. Keep in mind that feather falling will also reduce the amount of base damage dealt when you fall._

**Roll**: Rolling is an active sub-skill with a passive component. It provides a chance to negate fall damage based on the player's Acrobatics skill level. At level 50, the player has a 50% chance to negate damage, or 100% if Graceful Roll is activated. Every level increases the chance to roll successfully by 1%. Therefore, it will always trigger at level 100.

_A normal roll can be transformed into a Graceful Roll by sneaking while falling. Doing so will double the odds to roll and the amount of damage prevented._

**Dodge** (passive subs skill):
Dodge will give you a chance of reducing incoming damage by half. For instance, if you are receiving 6 damage, you will only receive 3 damage when successfully dodging. You will never dodge an attack if the incoming damage would be lethal, this check is done before dodge reduces incoming damage.
  _Dodge also has a cooldown before it will award XP if the player recently respawned from a death._

### Archery
Experience Gain: Experience is gained by dealing damage with a bow and arrows based on how far they are from their target.

Passive Sub Skill
**Skill Shot**:    
As a player continues to increase their skills in Archery, their arrows hit their mark more often and with greater force.
Skill Shot is the player's ability to deal increased damage to enemies with their bow and arrows. Gaining additional levels in Archery increases the chance to hit and the damage of the Skill Shot passive ability.

**Daze**:
With a well placed shot, even the most steadfast opponent will falter.

Daze is an effect that can trigger on some of the player's shots, causing their enemy to feel nauseated. Gaining additional levels in Archery increases the chance to daze their opponent. 

_*Note: This effect does not work on mobs._

**Retrieve**:
               _Even the most skilled Archer is nothing without their arrows._

Normally if you hit any entity or any player with a bow, you may not get the arrow back (in case of a bow without Infinity). With increase in Archery levels, there is a greater chance that the Arrow u shoot has a chance to recover. 

### Axes
Experience is gained by dealing damage to mobs, entities and players. (doesn't work in PvP arena)

**Skull Splitter**:
Skull Splitter adds an Area of Effect (AoE) to attacks with axes, dealing damage to nearby enemies whenever a target is hit. While using Skull Splitter, less damage is dealt to the primary target and an AoE effect is added to all attacks for the duration. This makes it great for crowds of enemies, but less effective when fighting one target!
_*Note: The ability lasts for a duration based on the Axes skill level._


**Axe Mastery**:
By using Axes frequently, the base damage dealt with them is increased.
The Axe Mastery passive ability increases the base damage dealt with axes as the Axes skill raises.

**Armor Impact**:
By using the cleaving force of axes, players have a chance to inflict bonus damage to the durability of their enemy's armor!
Armor Impact strikes increase the durability damage dealt based on the Axes skill level.

**Greater Impact**
While attacking with an axe, players have a chance to knock back their enemies with a powerful blow!
Greater Impact strikes increase the base damage dealt to enemies and knocks the enemy back with explosive force. These strikes gain no benefit from additional levels in Axes.

### Sword

**Serrated Strikes**:
Serrated Strikes is an active ability. You can activate it by right-clicking with a sword. This ability allows you to an AoE (Area of Effect) hit. This AoE will do a bonus 25% damage and inflict a bleed effect that lasts for 2 seconds.

Passive Skills

**Counter Attack**:
               _ Gives a chance to inflict/reflect a portion of the damage done to the player back on the attacker._
**Rupture**:
           _Gives a chance to inflict a DoT(Damage on Tick) debuff that effectively acts as if the mob is bleeding out._
### Unarmed
(Experience in Unarmed is gained by dealing damage with your fists to mobs, or players)

Super ability: 
  
**Berserk**
The Berserk ability is activated by right clicking with no items equipped, whilst you have a block or mob 'selected' in your crosshairs and then left clicking. Clicking when your crosshairs are aimed at something yet not selected (e.g., a faraway block) will not trigger the ability, nor ready the ability.   
When activated, Berserk has a few benefits. Firstly, if you left click on stone bricks they will change into cracked stone bricks. Secondly, blocks with no blast resistance (leaves, grass blocks, dirt, etc.) will break much faster with your bare hands. Thirdly, you receive a +50% damage boost on top of your current level's damage boost.

_The duration of Berserk increases by 1 second every 50 levels, and starts at 2 seconds at level 1._

**Gathering Skills**:

**Arrow Deflect**:
The Arrow Deflect passive sub-skill provides a chance to both deflect an arrow, and cause said arrow to ricochet back and hit your attacker. The chance to cause an arrow to be flung back at your attacker is much lower than that of a normal deflect.
Note: When this sub-skill unlocks at level 200 , it only has one rank but the chance to deflect continues to increase every 100 levels.

**Disarm** (is of no use for now as mcMMO is disabled in PvP arena)
The Disarm passive sub-skill provides a chance to disarm your opponent in a pvp fight. This has no effect in PvE; e.g., you cannot disarm a skeleton. This sub-skill can cause a player to drop anything currently held in their main hand, from blocks, to food, to weapons. Said item will drop on the ground, where you or your opponent will have a chance to pick it up.

This sub-skill has a maximum chance of 33%, which is attained at level 1000 . It is unlocked at level 250 (25 normal).
Iron Arm Style

The Iron Arm Style passive sub-skill provides extra damage to mobs and players you attack with your bare hands, which increases based on your Iron Arm Style rank. By default, this sub-skill adds +4 damage (2 hearts) at rank 1. Note that this is raw damage, prior to armour calculation - think of it like the +4 damage displayed on a wooden sword. Your rank increases at a configurable level threshold.

**Iron Grip**
The Iron Grip passive sub-skill which exists solely to provide you with a chance to negate another player's Disarm skill. Iron grip has a 100% chance at level 1000 (100 normal), which will effectively make it impossible for you to be disarmed.
This sub-skill is unlocked at level 600  and starts with a 60% chance to not be disarmed. It increases by 1%, every 10 (1 normal) levels.

**Limit Break**: 
The Limit Break sub-skill is intended to make Protection IV players less tanky and for you to feel more powerful for having a high skill level. Limit Break has 10 ranks, each rank gives 1 extra raw damage, this is damage before reductions from armour and enchantments. The net result is you deal about 50% more damage with an end game skill compared to before. At max rank, you can two-hit a player in normal diamond armour, whereas it takes around five hits to kill a player in Protection IV diamond armour.

For PvP, this sub-skill only activates on a player when they have armour equipped. As such, players with no armour will not receive the extra damage. The extra damage is also scaled to what kind of armour the player is wearing. Leather, iron, gold, and chain will only have 25% of your current limit break damage. Diamond will have 50%, and netherite will have 75%.
The limit break sub-skill is unlocked at level 100 .

### Fishing

### Herbalism

(Experience is gained by breaking blocks that are considered crops) 
The Herbalism skill offers extra drops and automatic crop planning, saving time and effort. It also has some interesting sub-skills, such as being able to add moss to cobblestone and stone bricks.
Super ability

**Green Terra**:   
Is activated by right-clicking on anything (except dirt) with a hoe and then harvesting crops with it. It provides triple drops and crops will be automatically replanted at a very high growth level until the ability wears off. The appropriate seed type needs to be in your inventory for this replanting.
Alternatively, right-clicking on anything except dirt with a hoe and then clicking on stonebrick, dirt, or cobble while having wheat seeds in the inventory will use the seeds to instantly convert the target blocks into mossy stonebrick, grass, or mossy cobble while the ability is active.

Active sub-skills

**Green Thumb** (Blocks)
Provides the chance to apply moss to dirt, cobblestone or stone bricks by right-clicking on it with wheat seeds, which will be consumed in the process. The chance for a successful convert increases with the player's Herbalism level.

**Shroom Thumb**
Provides the chance to turn dirt into mycelium by clicking on it with a mushroom. The player must have both red and brown mushrooms in their inventory, which will be consumed in the process. The chance for a successful convert increases with the player's Herbalism level.
Passive sub-skills

**Green Thumb**(Crops)
Provides a chance to automatically replant crops upon harvesting them with a hoe. The chance increases with the player's Herbalism level.
Double Drops
Increases harvesting precision, granting double drops upon harvesting crops. The chance increases with the player's Herbalism level.

**Farmer's Diet**:
Increases the amount of hunger restored by grown food (bread, carrots, potatoes, cookies, melons, mushroom soup and carrots) as the player's Herbalism level increases. The bonus hunger restoration is determined by a rank:
Herbalism Level	Rank Bonus Hunger Restoration
  0–19	    0	 0
 20–39	    I	 1
 40–59	   II	 2
 60-79	  III	 3
 80–99	   IV	 4
 100+	    V	 5

**Hylian Luck**:
Gives a small chance of finding rare items upon breaking specific materials with a sword. Dead bushes may yield melon seeds, pumpkin seeds and cocoa beans. Flowers may yield carrots, potatoes and apples. Smashing a naturally generated flower pot may yield an emerald, diamond or gold nugget. The chance for a drop increases with the player's Herbalism level.

### Mining

Super ability:
**Super Breaker**
The Super Breaker ability is activated by right clicking on any block that can yield experience and then left clicking on said block. 
When activated, Super Breaker will apply an additive +5 rank Efficiency enchantment to your currently held pickaxe and give you a chance at triple drops. E.g., if your pickaxe currently has Efficiency 5, activating Super Breaker will give you Efficiency 10 for the duration of the ability.
The duration of Super Breaker increases by 1 second every 50 (5 normal) levels, and starts at 2 seconds at level 1.

**Woodcutting**
Experience Gain
Experience is gained by harvesting logs, stripped logs, wood blocks, mushroom blocks, and mushroom stems.

Super Ability:

**Tree Feller**:
Activate the Tree Feller ability by right clicking on any non-log block while holding an axe. Right clicking on a log will strip the log.
When activated, breaking a log block will automatically break all blocks related to that tree in the vicinity, up to a certain size.
Higher levels provide larger harvestable tree sizes, as well as more storable charges of the Tree Feller ability (Default is 1, with 2 at Rank 3 and 3 at Rank 4).

Passive SubSkill

**Harvest Lumber**
Harvest Lumber gives a chance of harvesting an additional log, which by default starts at a 1% chance at level 10 and increases by 1% every 1 10 levels to a cap of 100% at max level.


Misc skills:

### Alchemy
**Catalysis**: Speeds up potion brewing.
**Concoctions**: Allows for more ingredients.
We also can brew some extra potions after reaching level 250, we can brew potion of haste, mining fatigue, Nostalgia, hunger and darkness.  

### Repair
**Arcane Forging**
Level Requirement: 100
Arcane Forging allows you to repair items with a certain change of maintaining its enchantments. The enchantments may be kept at their existing levels, downgraded to a lower level, or list entirely. The effectiveness of this skill depends on your rank/level


**Repair Mastery**
Level Requirement: 200
Repair Mastery increases the repair amount. The extra amount repaired is influenced by your Repair skill level.

**Super Repair**
Level Requirement: 400
Super Repair is a passive ability. When repairing an item it grants players a chance to repair with double effectiveness. The likelihood of this happening starts at 40% at level 400 and it increases by 1% every 10 levels to 100% at 1000.

### Child Skills
**Salvage**:

Advanced Salvage
Unlocks at Salvage level 35 by default When unlocked, this ability allows you to salvage damaged items. The yield percentage increases as you level up. A higher yield means that you can get more materials back. With advanced salvage you will always get 1 material back, unless the item is too damaged. So you don't have to worry about destroying items without getting anything in return. To illustrate how this works, here's an example: Let's say we salvage a gold pickaxe which is damaged for 20%, this means that the maximum amount you could get is only 2 (because the pick is crafted with 3 ingots - each worth 33,33% durability) which is equal to 66%. If your yield percentage is below 66% you are not able to get 2 ingots. If it is above this value you are able to gain the "full amount", which means that you will get 2 ingots.

**Arcane Salvaging**:

Unlocks at Salvage level 2 by default This ability allows you to get enchanted books when salvaging enchanted items. Depending on your level the chance of successfully extracting a full or partial enchantment varies. When an enchantment is partially extracted, the enchantment book will have a lower level enchantment compared to what it was on the item.

## Greenhouse
* Greenhouses is an essential plugin to power-up your OneBlock world! It enables players to build their own biome greenhouses complete with weather, friendly mob spawning, unique plant growth and even block erosion!

* Greenhouses are made out of glass and must contain the blocks found in the Biome Recipe to be valid. There is a recipe GUI. Once built, the greenhouse can be used to grow plants with bonemeal, and it may spawn biome-specific mobs. If you include a hopper with water in it, snow will form inside the greenhouse when it rains. If you put bonemeal in the hopper, biome-specific plants will grow. Some blocks can also transform over time due to "erosion".

### Features
Craft your own self-contained biome greenhouse on an island (or elsewhere if you like)
Greenhouses can grow plants that cannot normally be grown, like sunflowers
Friendly mobs can spawn if your greenhouse is well designed - need slimes? Build a swamp greenhouse!
Blocks change in biomes - dirt becomes sand in a desert, dirt becomes clay in a river, for example.
Greenhouses can run in multiple worlds.
Easy to use GUI shows greenhouse recipes (/gh)
Admins can fully customize biomes and recipes
How to Build A Greenhouse (Simple version)
Make glass blocks and build a rectangular set of walls with a flat roof.
Put a hopper in the wall or roof.
Put a door in the wall so you can get in and out.
Type /gh and read the rules for the greenhouse you want.
Exit the GUI and place blocks, water, lava and ice so that you make your desired biome.
Type /gh again and click on the biome to make it.
* Once made: Use bonemeal to grow small plants on grass immediately in the greenhouse.
Or place bonemeal in the hopper to have the greenhouse sprinkle bonemeal automatically. Come back later to see what grows!
Place a bucket of water (or more) in the hopper to cause snow to fall in cold biomes. Snow will fall when it rains in the world. Each snowfall empties one bucket of water.
Friendly biome-specific mobs may spawn in your greenhouse - the usual rules apply (be more than 24 blocks away).
Enjoy!
