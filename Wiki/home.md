## How to get started?

Once you get in server, you need to do /register <password> <password>, well if you wonder why you need to do this? then its just for the safety of your account and also you don't have to type the /register again while logging just do /login <password> or /l <password> , password here can be anything you want, but we suggest to make a strong password and also remember it.
